# Object-Avoiding-Robotic-Car
In this project we are making a object avoiding robotic car using arduino UNO and L298N Motor Driver. So I am going to provide a C Program for Arduino And A circuit diagram
This project developed an obstacle avoiding
robot to detect and avoid obstacles in its path. The
robot is built on the Arduino platform for data processing
and its software counterpart helped to communicate
with the robot to send parameters for guiding
movement. For obstacle detection, three ultrasonic
distance sensors were used that provided a wider field
of detection. The robot is fully autonomous and after the
initial loading of the code, it requires no user intervention
during its operation. When placed in unknown
environment with obstacles, it moved while avoiding all
obstacles with considerable accuracy.
The work done in this project can act as a base
for further improvements to increase accuracy and
adaptability of obstacle detection in diverse
environments. In future, the authors of this project intend
to test the feasibility of integrating different types of
sensors to complement each otherâ€™s disadvantages. For
instance, imaging sensor can be beneficial when
ultrasonic sensor may not correctly identify obstacles in
environment subjected to ambient noise and varying
temperature or air pressure. The accuracy of
determining the distance to the obstacles can be
increased by the inclusion of an electronic barometer for
automatic adjustment of the speed of sound in air. Also
the addition of a Bluetooth device can offer the flexibility
of remotely changing control parameters in the code.
